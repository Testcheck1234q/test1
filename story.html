        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <p>
            Medimitr began as a personal journey of discovery and growth. Our founder, Hani, experienced firsthand the challenges of post-surgery recovery while undergoing a difficult medical procedure. This experience revealed a gap in the healthcare system for easily accessible post-operative care information. Determined to fill this gap, Hani set out to create a platform that would offer comprehensive, easy-to-understand health notes for patients recovering from surgeries, especially in areas like maternal health and complex medical procedures.
        </p>
        <p>
            What started as a personal struggle soon turned into a mission to help others in similar situations. Hani spent countless hours researching ways to improve the patient recovery process, focusing on the lack of adequate support for individuals who need information after leaving the hospital. From these beginnings, Medimitr was born.

We believe that by delivering tailored, easy-to-understand health information directly to patients, we can bridge the gap between clinical care and home recovery. The Medimitr platform is designed to empower individuals with personalized health notes for post-surgery care, maternal recovery, and more.
            </p>
            <p>
