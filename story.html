        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <p>
            Medimitr began as a personal journey of discovery and growth. Our founder, Hani, experienced firsthand the challenges of post-surgery recovery while undergoing a difficult medical procedure. This experience revealed a gap in the healthcare system for easily accessible post-operative care information. Determined to fill this gap, Hani set out to create a platform that would offer comprehensive, easy-to-understand health notes for patients recovering from surgeries, especially in areas like maternal health and complex medical procedures.
        </p>
        <p>
            What started as a personal struggle soon turned into a mission to help others in similar situations. Hani spent countless hours researching ways to improve the patient recovery process, focusing on the lack of adequate support for individuals who need information after leaving the hospital. From these beginnings, Medimitr was born.

            <h2>Our Motivation</h2>
            <p>
                At Medimitr, we are driven by the belief that accessible healthcare information can make a significant difference in the lives of patients. We are motivated by a simple yet powerful idea: no one should feel lost or unsupported during their recovery process. Our goal is to provide patients with the tools they need to take control of their recovery journey and to make informed decisions about their health.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our team is passionate about using technology to solve real-world healthcare challenges. We believe that by delivering tailored, easy-to-understand health information directly to patients, we can bridge the gap between clinical care and home recovery. The Medimitr platform is designed to empower individuals with personalized health notes for post-surgery care, maternal recovery, and more.
            </p>
            <p>
                We continue to evolve and grow, motivated by the success stories of our users and their families. Every step we take is fueled by the desire to ensure that every patient has the information and support they need to recover fully and confidently.
